/*Missing a decleration of a new object here we are refering to Operations
which we gave a value of myOpp. using .myOpp tells the code to use the public class Operations
Public Operations "goes to class" myOpp"what we refer to this whole block as now".
Then we creat the new object of myOpp = "new" Operations. Basicly we created a bluprint that is being
pulled up from so that we can apply it here in this block.*/
